This exercise shows that hydrogen gas can be treated classically
at standard temperature and pressure.

It accomplishes this by calculating
the `mean interparticle separation`_
by the equation

.. math::
    x = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{m}{\rho} }

where

| :math:`m` is the mass of a single gas molecule (e.g. :math:`H_2`) and
| :math:`\rho` is the density of the gas

and the `thermal de Broglie wavelength`_
by the equation

.. math::
    \lambda = \frac{ h }
    {
      \sqrt{2 \pi m k_B T}
    }

where

| :math:`h` is the Planck constant,
| :math:`m` is the mass of a single gas molecule,
| :math:`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, and
| :math:`T` is the temperature of the gas.

Since the interparticle spacing is higher than the thermal de Broglie wavelength
by about two orders of magnitude at standard temperature and pressure,
hydrogen gas can be modeled as a classical gas.
